# AdSense Rejection: Low Value Content  
## Action Plan for All The Calculators

---

## Summary

Google AdSense rejected the site under **“Low value content.”**

This does NOT mean:
- The site violates policies
- The site is low quality
- The project is failing

It means the site currently lacks enough depth, breadth, and authority to meet AdSense publisher network standards.

This is common for new utility sites.

# What “Low Value Content” Means for Calculator Sites

For tools and calculators, this usually indicates one or more of:

1. Pages are mostly functional (inputs + result) with limited supporting content  
2. Not enough total pages  
3. Limited explanation or educational context  
4. New domain with low authority  
5. Content similar to widely available calculators  

Google needs stronger signals that:
- The site provides meaningful value beyond the tool itself
- Users gain understanding, not just output

---

# What Needs To Be Improved

## 1. Expand Each Calculator Page

Every calculator should include:

### Required Additions
- What this calculator does
- How the formula works (clear explanation)
- Example calculation
- Common mistakes
- When to use this calculator
- Related calculators
- 2–4 FAQs

### Target Depth
- 400–800 words per calculator page
- Clear headings and structured layout
- Helpful, specific explanations (no filler)

---

## 2. Increase Total Calculator Count

Current site likely has too few pages.

Target:
- 15–25 solid calculators

New calculators do not need to be complex, but must be useful.

Examples:
- APR calculator
- Compound interest (monthly vs yearly)
- Stamp duty (UK)
- Pension contribution
- Net to gross salary
- Break-even calculator

---

## 3. Add 1–2 Anchor Guide Pages

Create longer educational pages (1,000+ words) that:

- Explain a topic in depth
- Link to related calculators
- Provide structured guidance

Example:
- “Complete Guide to UK Mortgage Calculations”
- “Understanding Take Home Pay in the UK”

These pages increase:
- Perceived authority
- SEO strength
- AdSense trust signals

---

## 4. Strengthen Internal Linking

Each calculator page should:
- Link to related calculators
- Be linked from category pages
- Encourage multi-page sessions

Goal:
Increase pages per session and reduce bounce rate.

---

# What Not To Do

- Do not resubmit immediately
- Do not add thin calculators just to inflate count
- Do not add AI-generated filler text
- Do not redesign unnecessarily

This is a depth issue, not a design issue.

---

# Timeline for Reapplication

Recommended approach:

Week 1–2:
- Expand existing calculator pages
- Add 3–5 new calculators

Week 3:
- Add at least one anchor guide page
- Improve internal linking

Week 4:
- Let Google re-crawl and index
- Then request review in AdSense

Second submissions are significantly more likely to succeed when content depth improves.

---

# Strategic Perspective

The site already has:
- Clean UX
- Real users
- International traffic
- Strong technical setup

This rejection reflects site maturity, not failure.

With added depth and breadth, approval likelihood increases substantially.

---

# Goal

Transform the site from:
> A collection of tools

Into:
> A trusted, educational utility resource

Once that shift is visible, AdSense approval becomes much more likely.
