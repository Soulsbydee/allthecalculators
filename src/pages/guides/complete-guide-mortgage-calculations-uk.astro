        This guide explains the key calculations behind UK mortgages: how much you might borrow, how monthly payments are
        estimated, how interest builds up over time, and how overpayments can change your total cost. It is written for
        practical planning, not regulated advice.

      <h2 class="text-[18px] font-semibold tracking-tight">Why mortgage calculations matter</h2>
      <p class="text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        Most people focus on the house price first. In practice, the monthly payment, deposit, fees, and stamp duty
        determine whether a purchase is affordable. A property can look affordable on paper but still strain cash flow
        once maintenance, insurance, and other costs are included.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        Good planning usually starts with three questions:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        <li>How much can I borrow?</li>
        <li>What will monthly repayments look like?</li>
        <li>How much interest and tax will I pay over time?</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">

      <h2 class="text-[18px] font-semibold tracking-tight">1) Mortgage affordability: the borrowing estimate</h2>
      <p class="text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        A simple affordability estimate is based on income multiplied by a lending factor (often around 4x to 4.5x).
        Example: £90,000 household income × 4.5 = £405,000 estimated maximum mortgage.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        This estimate is useful, but lenders also apply stress tests and spending assessments. Existing loans, childcare,
        and credit commitments can reduce what you can borrow even when headline income looks strong.
      </p>
      <h3 class="text-base font-semibold tracking-tight">Worked example</h3>
      <p class="text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        If your combined income is £70,000 and you use a 4.25 multiple, estimated borrowing is about £297,500. With a
        £30,000 deposit, estimated maximum property price is around £327,500.

      <h2 class="text-[18px] font-semibold tracking-tight">2) Monthly repayments: what changes the payment most</h2>
      <p class="text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        Repayments depend mainly on three inputs: loan amount, interest rate, and term length. The biggest drivers are
        rate and term. Small rate increases can significantly affect monthly cost, especially on long terms.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        Extending a term lowers monthly cost but usually increases total interest. Shortening a term increases monthly
        pressure but often reduces long-run borrowing cost.
      </p>
      <h3 class="text-base font-semibold tracking-tight">Worked example</h3>
      <p class="text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        A £250,000 mortgage at 5% over 25 years gives an estimated monthly repayment around £1,460. At 6%, repayment
        rises substantially. Over the full term, total interest difference can be very large.

    <section class="space-y-3">
      <h2 class="text-[18px] font-semibold tracking-tight">3) Deposit and loan-to-value (LTV)</h2>
      <p class="text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        LTV is mortgage amount divided by property value. Lower LTV often unlocks better rates. For example, moving from
        90% LTV to 75% LTV can improve available products and reduce interest over time.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        Deposit planning should include more than the purchase price gap. You also need legal fees, valuation, moving
        costs, and stamp duty where applicable.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-[18px] font-semibold tracking-tight">4) Stamp duty and upfront cash requirements</h2>
      <p class="text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        Stamp Duty Land Tax (England) is banded, not flat. That means parts of the property price are taxed at different
        rates. First-time buyer relief and additional property surcharges can change the final amount materially.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        Many buyers underestimate upfront cash because they budget for deposit only. In reality, total cash required is
        usually: deposit + SDLT + legal fees + lender and moving costs.

      <h2 class="text-[18px] font-semibold tracking-tight">5) Overpayments: reducing term vs reducing payment</h2>
      <p class="text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        Overpaying generally reduces principal faster, which reduces interest charged in later months. This can shorten
        your term significantly, especially in early years when a larger part of each payment goes to interest.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        Most lenders limit overpayments (often a percentage per year) during fixed periods. Always check your product
        terms before committing to an overpayment strategy.
      </p>
      <h3 class="text-base font-semibold tracking-tight">Worked example</h3>
      <p class="text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        If you overpay £150 per month on a long-term loan, you may cut years from the repayment term and save substantial
        interest, depending on rate and balance.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-[18px] font-semibold tracking-tight">6) Rate changes and stress testing</h2>
      <p class="text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        Fixed periods end. If rates rise at remortgage time, monthly repayments can jump even when your balance is lower.
        A practical approach is to test affordability at higher rates before taking on maximum borrowing.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        A simple stress test is to run payment scenarios at your expected rate and at +1% to +2% above it. If both are
        manageable, your plan is usually more robust.

      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        <li>Choosing the maximum borrowing amount without a monthly buffer.</li>
        <li>Ignoring stamp duty and transaction costs in cash planning.</li>
        <li>Assuming the initial fixed rate lasts for the full mortgage term.</li>
        <li>Skipping overpayment checks against early repayment terms.</li>
        <li>Comparing mortgage offers on monthly payment only, not total cost.</li>

          <p class="mt-1">
            No. It is an estimate. Lenders use additional checks including credit profile and detailed outgoings.

          <h3 class="text-base font-semibold tracking-tight text-[rgb(var(--text))]">Should I choose a longer term to make payments easier?</h3>
          <p class="mt-1">
            Longer terms can improve monthly affordability but often increase total interest. Run both options and compare.

          <p class="mt-1">
            Not always. It depends on your mortgage rate, emergency fund, and other debt costs.
