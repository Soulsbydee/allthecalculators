      <p class="text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        Take-home pay is the amount that lands in your bank after deductions from gross salary. This guide explains the
        main parts of UK deductions and how to estimate net pay for budgeting, job comparisons, and affordability checks.

      <h2 class="text-[18px] font-semibold tracking-tight">Gross vs net pay</h2>
      <p class="text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        Gross salary is your pay before deductions. Net (take-home) pay is what remains after income tax, National
        Insurance, pension contributions, and any student loan repayments.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        Two people with the same gross salary can have different net pay because of pension rate, loan plan, tax code,
        and region-specific rules.
      </p>

    <section class="space-y-3">
      <h2 class="text-[18px] font-semibold tracking-tight">The four main deductions</h2>
      <h3 class="text-base font-semibold tracking-tight">1) Income tax</h3>
      <p class="text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        Income tax is progressive: different slices of income are taxed at different rates. That means moving into a
        higher band does not tax your full salary at that higher rate, only the portion above the threshold.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-base font-semibold tracking-tight">2) National Insurance (NI)</h3>
      <p class="text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        NI is separate from income tax and is also based on thresholds. It is usually one of the biggest payroll
        deductions after tax.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-base font-semibold tracking-tight">3) Pension contributions</h3>
      <p class="text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        Workplace pension contributions reduce immediate take-home pay but build long-term retirement savings. Depending
        on scheme setup, contributions can interact with tax and NI differently.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-base font-semibold tracking-tight">4) Student loan repayments</h3>
      <p class="text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        Student loan deductions depend on plan type and thresholds. Repayments are typically a percentage of earnings
        above a threshold, not a fixed monthly amount.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="space-y-3">
      <h2 class="text-[18px] font-semibold tracking-tight">Worked example: gross to net</h2>
      <p class="text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        Suppose salary is £45,000 with no student loan and no pension contribution. Your estimated annual deductions are
        mainly income tax and NI, producing a monthly take-home figure around the high £2,000s.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        If you add a 5% pension contribution, take-home pay falls short-term, but retirement contributions increase. This
        is one reason comparing offers by gross salary alone can be misleading.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="space-y-3">
      <h2 class="text-[18px] font-semibold tracking-tight">Worked example: net target to gross salary</h2>
      <p class="text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        If you need £2,500 per month net for living costs, you can reverse-calculate the gross salary needed. The exact
        gross depends on pension and student loan settings.
      </p>

        <a class="underline ml-1" href="/calculators/net-to-gross-salary">Net to gross salary calculator</a>

    <section class="space-y-3">
      <h2 class="text-[18px] font-semibold tracking-tight">How to budget using take-home pay</h2>
      <p class="text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        A practical monthly budget usually starts from net pay, not gross pay. Once you know realistic take-home income,
        split spending into essentials, financial goals, and discretionary spending.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        <li>Essentials: rent/mortgage, bills, transport, food.</li>
        <li>Goals: emergency fund, pension top-ups, debt repayment.</li>
        <li>Discretionary: dining, travel, subscriptions, hobbies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        If affordability is tight, test scenarios before making commitments: lower rent/mortgage, different pension rate,
        or more conservative spending assumptions.
      </p>

    <section class="space-y-3">
      <h2 class="text-[18px] font-semibold tracking-tight">Common mistakes</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        <li>Assuming gross salary equals spendable income.</li>
        <li>Ignoring pension and student loan effects when comparing jobs.</li>
        <li>Using monthly estimates without checking annual totals.</li>
        <li>Forgetting that tax thresholds can change over time.</li>
        <li>Comparing offers without considering commute or benefits costs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-[18px] font-semibold tracking-tight">How this affects mortgage affordability</h2>
      <p class="text-sm text-[rgb(var(--muted))]">
        Lenders typically assess affordability with detailed income and outgoings, not just salary multiples. Your
        actual monthly cash flow still matters because repayment stress is felt in net pay, not gross pay.
      </p>

          <h3 class="text-base font-semibold tracking-tight text-[rgb(var(--text))]">Why is my payslip different from calculator results?</h3>
          <p class="mt-1">
            Calculators use simplified assumptions. Your payslip may include tax code differences, benefits, bonuses,
            salary sacrifice, and other payroll settings.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-base font-semibold tracking-tight text-[rgb(var(--text))]">Should I reduce pension contributions to improve cash flow?</h3>
          <p class="mt-1">
            It can increase short-term net pay, but may reduce long-term retirement outcomes and employer matching value.
            Model both scenarios before changing contributions.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-base font-semibold tracking-tight text-[rgb(var(--text))]">Is net pay enough for planning?</h3>
          <p class="mt-1">
            Net pay is the right start for monthly budgeting, but you should also review annual costs, emergency savings,
            and medium-term goals.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-base font-semibold tracking-tight text-[rgb(var(--text))]">How often should I re-check take-home estimates?</h3>
          <p class="mt-1">
            Re-check when salary changes, pension settings change, student loan plan changes, or new tax-year rules are
            announced.
